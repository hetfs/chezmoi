## Getting Started

To begin managing your dotfiles with **chezmoi**, initialize it first:

```bash
chezmoi init
```

This command creates a local Git repository at `~/.local/share/chezmoi` (on Windows, it will be `C:\Users\%USERPROFILE%\.local\share\chezmoi`) to store your dotfiles' source state.

### Example: Adding `.bashrc`

To add `.bashrc` to **chezmoi**:

```bash
chezmoi add ~/.bashrc
```

This copies `.bashrc` to the chezmoi source directory as `~/.local/share/chezmoi/dot_bashrc`. To edit it later:

```bash
chezmoi edit ~/.bashrc
```

After making your edits, preview the changes:

```bash
chezmoi diff
```

To apply the changes, use:

```bash
chezmoi -v apply
```

The `-v` (verbose) flag will show exactly what changes will be made. For a dry run, combine the `-n` and `-v` options.

### Committing Changes

Once you've completed your edits, commit the changes to Git:

```bash
chezmoi cd
git add .
git commit -m "Update dotfiles"
```
